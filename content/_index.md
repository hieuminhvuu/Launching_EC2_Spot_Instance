# Launching EC2 Spot Instances

### Overview

In this workshop you learn about the fundamentals of EC2 Spot Instances and recommended tools to launch Spot Instances, test for resiliency, and view pricing history.

You play the role of a DevOps engineer who is given a sample application and tasked to deploy it cost efficiently using EC2 Auto Scaling groups and EC2 Fleet in an optimal AWS Region. Post deployment you simulate Spot Instance interruptions to test the resiliency of Auto Scaling groups, and finally calculate the estimated cost savings.

### Estimated time and cost to run this workshop

The estimated time for completing the workshop is 45 to 60 minutes. The estimated cost is less than $5.
