To provision AWS resources in a programmatic manner you run AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) commands in AWS CloudShell. All the CLI commands you are going to run can be reproduced using CloudFormation, AWS SDKs, and Terraform.

### AWS CloudShell

AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell console that makes it easy to securely manage, explore, and interact with your AWS resources. To launch CloudShell click on the shortcut available in the top navigation bar (highlighted in green in below image), or simply click on this AWS CloudShell console link.
